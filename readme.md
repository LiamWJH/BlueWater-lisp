# Blue water
_"A small rapid progressising Lisp in development."_
**Thank you **
## Introduction
Blue water is a smol cute lisp dialect written in python! Although small we seek growth from it. In case you dont know what lisp is go look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))

## What Can It Do?
Here's some of the stuff you can do with BlueWater:

**Math Operations:**
- Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Comparisons: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
- Advanced math: `mod`, `pow`, `sqrt`, `abs`

**Working with Data:**
- Variables: `set` to store values
- Lists: `list` to make lists, `append` to add stuff
- List operations: `len`, `reverse`, `index` to manage elements

**Strings & Text:**
- String creation with quotes
- String operations: `concat`, `strlen`, `substr`

**Control Flow:**
- Conditionals: `if` statements
- Loops: `while` loops
- Logic: `&` (and), `|` (or), `true`, `false`

**Input/Output:**
- Print to console: `print`
- Read input: `scan`

## Goals
We have several goals for this project:
 1. Feature progression - Of course we want _rapid_ growth!
 2. Good documentation - We also aim for a _quality_ repo!
 3. Open contributions - We want people to be able to contribute _actively_!
 4. Clean code - Of course we want _clean_ code and _structured_ projects!
