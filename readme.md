# BWT - _Lisp btw_
## Blue WaTer a chaotic take on making a lisp dialect

Not much to say **blue water** is as simple as i said repeatedly in the headers; A lisp dialect that aims to be: 
1. usable _(To an extent rn)_
2. chaotic _Yes_
3. Pure python _Yes_
4. Easy to read the code  _Not even close_

If you dont know about the [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) families they are in short: a familiy of programming language that the code itself is a form of data type.
To show an easy example of the vibe such is the infamous _"hello world"_ and other programs in lisp dialects
> (print "Hello world")      ; Print hello world

> (+ 2 (* 2 4))                   ; Outputs 10

So now we know we can do TWO THINGS you can either go read the *contributing.txt* in the *docs* or just try using it.

## How to use
For now our *bwt* only supports *file read -> output* form of runnning (for REPL style bwt YOU can contribute for US)

So you can run:
```git clone "https://github.com/LiamWJH/bwt-lispbtw"``` In C:\ or anywhere
```cd "bwt-lispbtw"```
```cd src```
```python main.py TESTFILENAME```
