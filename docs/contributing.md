To start do:

1. Cloning repo :D

(Fork the project)

```git clone https://www.github.com/LiamWJH/Calx-lisp```

```cd "Calx-lisp"```

2. Choosing :D
Once you finished step 1 you will see several folders like _/docs_, _/Calx_ and files like _LICENSE_, and _readme_, if you wish you can contribute to any of these go to step 2.

3. IF YOU CHOSE TO EDIT THE **CODE**
If you chose to edit the code or the python code, go to via _/Calx_ folder then you can go to the _/src_ folder to edit the source code!

{**IMPORTANT** Do not try to make the code dysfunctional, always test all the test cases to see if your new code qualifies all of them!}

4. IF YOU CHOSE TO EDIT THE **TEST CASES**
If you chose to edit the test cases for Ordinta , go to via _/Calx_ folder then you can go to the _/tests_ folder to add, edit, delete the test cases!

{**IMPORTANT**  Before making, deleting, editing the test cases PLEASE review the features and code and the basics of Ordinta to make sure they're valid}

5. IF YOU CHOSE TO EDIT THE **readme, todo, contributing, /docs, and other**
If you chose to do as you state then make sure all the content arent wrong or contradicting to our current state and do so!

6. LASTLY
Lastly after you have succesfully made your changes go make a PR or pull request! Then i will review the code and proceed! (From a fork)
